# MBTI-Prediction
This paper introduces a machine learning approach to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types based on survey responses. By leveraging advanced algorithms, our model accurately classifies individuals into their respective personality types, contributing to the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.

# INTRODUCTION
The MBTI personality prediction project utilizes machine learning methodologies to predict personality types based on individuals' behavioral patterns and preferences. The MBTI divides individuals into 16 personality types using four pairs of characteristics. By analyzing a dataset of MBTI survey responses, the machine learning model is trained to accurately classify individuals into one of the 16 personality types. This project aims to deepen our understanding of human behavior and has potential applications in psychology, team dynamics, and personalization. It showcases the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence, highlighting the predictive capabilities of machine learning in categorizing human personality traits.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) sorts people into one of 16 personality types, determined by four dimensions:
•INTROVERSION (I) – EXTROVERSION (E)
• INTUITION (N) – SENSING (S)
• THINKING (T) – FEELING (F)
• JUDGING (J) – PERCEIVING (P)
