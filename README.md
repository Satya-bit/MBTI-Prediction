# MBTI-Prediction
This paper introduces a machine learning approach to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types based on survey responses. By leveraging advanced algorithms, our model accurately classifies individuals into their respective personality types, contributing to the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.

# INTRODUCTION
The MBTI personality prediction project utilizes machine learning methodologies to predict personality types based on individuals' behavioral patterns and preferences. The MBTI divides individuals into 16 personality types using four pairs of characteristics. By analyzing a dataset of MBTI survey responses, the machine learning model is trained to accurately classify individuals into one of the 16 personality types. This project aims to deepen our understanding of human behavior and has potential applications in psychology, team dynamics, and personalization. It showcases the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence, highlighting the predictive capabilities of machine learning in categorizing human personality traits.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) sorts people into one of 16 personality types, determined by four dimensions:
•INTROVERSION (I) – EXTROVERSION (E)
• INTUITION (N) – SENSING (S)
• THINKING (T) – FEELING (F)
• JUDGING (J) – PERCEIVING (P)

# DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset focuses on exploring the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a widely used personality type system categorizing individuals into one of 16 distinct types based on preferences in four axes: Introversion/Extroversion, Intuition/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. This system, rooted in Carl Jung's cognitive functions theory, has enjoyed extensive usage across various domains including businesses, online platforms, research, and personal interest. Despite its popularity, the MBTI's validity has faced scrutiny due to inconsistencies in experimental results. The dataset aims to investigate if any discernible patterns exist between specific MBTI types and writing styles, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse surrounding the test's efficacy in predicting and categorizing behavior.
The dataset consists of over 8600 rows, with each row representing a person's MBTI type (a 4-letter code denoting their personality type) along with a section containing the last 50 posts made by that person. The posts are separated by "|||" (3 pipe characters).

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
We meticulously examined the dataset's composition and delved into the distribution of personality types. Through correlation and comparative analyses, we unveiled intriguing patterns and insights into behavioral trends across different MBTI types. While mindful of limitations, our findings fuel our quest for deeper understanding, guiding future investigations into the rich tapestry of human personality dynamics.
